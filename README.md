# 🚀 Project Name – LEO Environmental Lab


---

## 🌍 Project Overview  
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is rapidly becoming crowded with satellites, space debris, and operational challenges. While LEO enables critical services — internet, climate monitoring, disaster response, and navigation — its long-term sustainability is at risk.  

Our project addresses this urgent challenge by developing a **scalable and sustainable business model and prototype for LEO commercialization**.  
We combine **NASA data, predictive algorithms, and modular frameworks** to ensure that businesses can operate in orbit **safely, sustainably, and inclusively**.  

The vision: Transform LEO from a congested, fragile environment into a **thriving marketplace for innovation and humanity’s future in space.**

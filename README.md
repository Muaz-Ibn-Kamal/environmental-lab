## üåç Project Overview  
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is rapidly becoming crowded with satellites, space debris, and operational challenges. While LEO enables critical services ‚Äî internet, climate monitoring, disaster response, and navigation ‚Äî its long-term sustainability is at risk.  

Our project addresses this urgent challenge by developing a **scalable and sustainable business model and prototype for LEO commercialization**.  
We combine **NASA data, predictive algorithms, and modular frameworks** to ensure that businesses can operate in orbit **safely, sustainably, and inclusively**.  

The vision: Transform LEO from a congested, fragile environment into a **thriving marketplace for innovation and humanity‚Äôs future in space.**
